# EDA
It's About Data Preprocessing,cleaning and Feature Extraction and also Datasets,Programming Files <br>
General points to remember;
# 1. Variables

    - x = independent variable = explanatory = predictor
    - y = dependent variable = response = target

# 2. Data Types
The type of data is essential as it determines what kind of tests can be applied to it.

- **i.Continuous:** Also known as quantitative. Unlimited number of values
- **ii.Categorical:** Also known as discrete or qualitative. Fixed number of values or categories

# 3. Bias-Variance Tradeoff
The best predictive algorithm is one that has **good Generalization Ability**. With that, it will be able to give accurate predictions to new and previously unseen data.

- **High Bias** results from *Underfitting the model*. This usually results from erroneous assumptions, and cause the model to be too general.

- **High Variance** results from *Overfitting the model*, and it will predict the training dataset very accurately, but not with unseen new datasets. This is because it will fit even the slightless noise in the dataset.

The best model with the highest accuarcy is the middle ground between the two.
